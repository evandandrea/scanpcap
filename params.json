{"name":"scanpcap","tagline":"","body":"`scanpcap` is a tool that scans through a packet capture file and prints\r\nstatistics about it.\r\n\r\nIt takes as an argument the name of a file (in pcapng format), and outputs\r\nsome basic statistics about them, such as:\r\n\r\n - Number of packets\r\n - Number of Ethernet packets\r\n - Number of ARP packets\r\n - Maximum packet size\r\n - Minimum packet size\r\n - Start, end, and elapsed time of the capture\r\n - Bytes captured (includingn truncated bytes)\r\n - Overall capture speed (bits captured divided by capture interval in seconds)\r\n\r\nFor Ethernet links, also reports on:\r\n - Count of packets per Ethernet source address\r\n - Count of packets per Ethernet destination address\r\n - Any ARP mappings observed\r\n\r\nSee Also\r\n========\r\n\r\nPlease note that `scanpcap` was written as a learning tool. Since it seemed\r\nuseful, I decided to release it.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are trying to do serious work with packet capturing, it\r\nmight be better to look at a more advanced tool, such as:\r\n\r\n - [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/)\r\n - [Bro Network Security Monitor](http://www.bro.org/)\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n========\r\n\r\n`scanpcap` includes a CMake build file. To build, ensure `cmake` is installed.\r\nThen do something like this:\r\n\r\n    $ mkdir build\r\n    $ cd build\r\n    $ cmake ..\r\n    $ make\r\n\r\nExample Output\r\n==============\r\n\r\n    $ ./scanpcap ~/example.pcapng\r\n    6938 packets\r\n    6938 Ethernet packets\r\n    940 ARP packets\r\n    Min size packet: 42\r\n    Max size packet: 1514\r\n    Average size packet: 101\r\n    Start time: 1399395954.205360 seconds (Tue May  6 10:05:54 2014)\r\n    End time: 1399397455.059807 seconds (Tue May  6 10:30:55 2014)\r\n    Total time: 1501 seconds (25.0 minutes)\r\n    Total bytes captured: 704371 bytes / 687 kilobytes / 0 megabytes\r\n    Overall capture speed: 3 Kbps (0 Mbps)\r\n\r\n    Ethernet destinations:\r\n           3 00:11:32:05:b8:58\r\n           4 00:19:5e:67:97:1c\r\n           4 00:1e:be:cd:e4:b0\r\n           6 00:23:7d:8d:d8:cd\r\n        1456 00:24:a5:af:24:85\r\n           4 00:24:d7:3f:ba:e0\r\n           5 00:d0:2d:22:12:23\r\n         207 01:00:5e:00:00:01\r\n          87 01:00:5e:00:00:fb\r\n         332 01:00:5e:7f:ff:fa\r\n         735 01:80:c2:00:00:00\r\n         130 04:a1:51:82:8b:23\r\n           4 06:a1:51:21:d5:ce\r\n           3 10:1c:0c:6b:53:00\r\n          81 33:33:00:00:00:fb\r\n          12 33:33:00:01:00:02\r\n          66 40:6c:8f:3a:09:cc\r\n        1778 60:03:08:a8:5c:30\r\n           2 70:de:e2:4a:13:50\r\n          25 90:2b:34:dc:7e:9d\r\n           2 94:de:80:6b:ca:55\r\n           5 d8:d1:cb:5d:c0:3b\r\n          34 f8:1e:df:df:f7:c0\r\n        1953 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\r\n\r\n    Ethernet sources:\r\n          69 00:11:32:05:b8:58\r\n           1 00:19:5e:67:97:1c\r\n           1 00:1e:be:cd:e4:b0\r\n          18 00:23:7d:8d:d8:cd\r\n        1572 00:24:a5:af:24:85\r\n           1 00:24:d7:3f:ba:e0\r\n         396 00:6b:9e:9a:f1:32\r\n          18 00:d0:2d:22:12:23\r\n        1374 04:a1:51:82:8b:23\r\n          21 06:a1:51:21:d5:ce\r\n          48 10:1c:0c:6b:53:00\r\n          31 10:bf:48:ee:4a:41\r\n         133 40:6c:8f:3a:09:cc\r\n          12 4c:b1:99:05:f6:4f\r\n        2411 60:03:08:a8:5c:30\r\n           5 68:5b:35:a5:fa:9a\r\n           3 70:de:e2:4a:13:50\r\n          43 90:2b:34:dc:7e:9d\r\n          53 94:de:80:6b:ca:55\r\n         126 bc:3b:af:49:05:ab\r\n          49 d8:d1:cb:5d:c0:3b\r\n         553 f8:1e:df:df:f7:c0\r\n\r\n    ARP table:\r\n        172.16.42.1          00:24:a5:af:24:85\r\n        172.16.42.10         00:1e:be:cd:e4:b0\r\n        172.16.42.110        00:19:5e:67:97:1c\r\n        172.16.42.150        d8:d1:cb:5d:c0:3b\r\n        172.16.42.152        06:a1:51:21:d5:ce\r\n        172.16.42.156        94:de:80:6b:ca:55\r\n        172.16.42.157        90:2b:34:dc:7e:9d\r\n        172.16.42.161        f8:1e:df:df:f7:c0\r\n        172.16.42.170        00:d0:2d:22:12:23\r\n        172.16.42.171        70:de:e2:4a:13:50\r\n        172.16.42.178        10:1c:0c:6b:53:00\r\n        172.16.42.180        00:6b:9e:9a:f1:32\r\n        172.16.42.183        00:24:d7:3f:ba:e0\r\n        172.16.42.192        00:11:32:05:b8:58\r\n        172.16.42.196        60:03:08:a8:5c:30\r\n        172.16.42.197        00:23:7d:8d:d8:cd\r\n        172.16.42.199        40:6c:8f:3a:09:cc\r\n        172.16.42.2          04:a1:51:82:8b:23\r\n        172.16.42.20         40:6c:8f:3a:09:cc\r\n        172.16.42.21         40:6c:8f:3a:09:cc\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n`scanpcap` is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n","google":"UA-50603789-1","note":"Don't delete this file!

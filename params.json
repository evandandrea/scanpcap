{"name":"scanpcap","tagline":"","body":"`scanpcap` is a tool that scans through a packet capture file and prints\r\nstatistics about it.\r\n\r\nIt takes as an argument the name of a file (in pcapng format), assumes that\r\nall the packets inside are Ethernet packets, and outputs some basic statistics\r\nabout them, such as:\r\n\r\n - Number of packets\r\n - Maximum packet size\r\n - Minimum packet size\r\n - Start, end, and elapsed time of the capture\r\n - Bytes captured (includingn truncated bytes)\r\n - Overall capture speed (bits captured divided by capture interval in seconds)\r\n - Count per Ethernet source address\r\n - Count per Ethernet destination address\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n========\r\n\r\n`scanpcap` includes a CMake build file. To build, ensure `cmake` is installed.\r\nThen do something like this:\r\n\r\n    $ mkdir build\r\n    $ cd build\r\n    $ cmake ..\r\n    $ make\r\n\r\nExample Output\r\n==============\r\n\r\n    $ ./scanpcap ~/example.pcapng\r\n    73759 packets\r\n    Max size packet: 1514\r\n    Min size packet: 54\r\n    Start time: 1398903401.944119 seconds (Wed Apr 30 17:16:41 2014)\r\n    End time: 1398904302.403040 seconds (Wed Apr 30 17:31:42 2014)\r\n    Total time: 901 seconds (15.0 minutes)\r\n    Total bytes captured: 50217316 bytes / 49040 kilobytes / 47 megabytes\r\n    Overall capture speed: 435 Kbps (0 Mbps)\r\n\r\n    Ethernet destinations:\r\n       27521 00:e0:74:22:96:f3\r\n         540 01:00:5e:00:00:57\r\n         344 01:00:5e:00:00:2b\r\n           1 01:00:5e:00:00:cf\r\n           1 01:00:5e:7f:ff:5b\r\n           3 33:33:00:00:00:01\r\n          25 33:33:00:00:00:02\r\n           8 33:33:00:00:00:f3\r\n          60 33:33:00:00:00:22\r\n          93 33:33:00:00:00:57\r\n          74 33:33:00:01:00:02\r\n         326 33:33:00:01:00:03\r\n           1 33:33:ff:2b:29:66\r\n           1 33:33:ff:4a:44:f3\r\n           1 33:33:ff:59:92:c5\r\n           1 33:33:ff:71:b6:3c\r\n           1 33:33:ff:44:c9:af\r\n           2 33:33:ff:d4:08:28\r\n       44067 60:03:08:99:5c:27\r\n         689 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\r\n\r\n    Ethernet sources:\r\n         124 00:23:67:b3:aa:cc\r\n       44220 00:e0:74:22:96:f3\r\n           1 10:1c:f3:5d:a0:df\r\n          50 40:27:04:2d:d3:bf\r\n         367 50:46:5d:15:47:6f\r\n          54 5c:51:4f:9e:00:bb\r\n       27554 60:03:08:99:5c:27\r\n          36 60:fe:c5:ca:27:85\r\n          17 74:e1:b6:af:f8:d2\r\n          49 84:3a:74:33:67:4c\r\n          20 88:53:95:7a:4d:ce\r\n          42 88:cb:87:be:b1:b3\r\n         318 8c:3a:e3:4a:44:f3\r\n           1 8c:7b:9d:e1:df:75\r\n         338 9c:2a:70:74:d4:21\r\n         434 a4:17:31:d0:c7:d7\r\n           6 ac:cf:ec:ed:31:32\r\n          33 b8:e8:56:1d:48:a2\r\n          11 b8:e8:56:a2:c6:d2\r\n          39 c4:85:08:f2:be:f3\r\n          45 dc:9b:9c:1a:24:de\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n`scanpcap` is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
